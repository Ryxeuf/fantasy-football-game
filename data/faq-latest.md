DESIGNER'S COMMENTARY MAY 2025
------------------------------

The following designer's commentary is intended to complement the Blood Bowl rulebook, any issues of Spike! Journal, and any supplements associated with the Second Season Edition of the game. It is presented as a series of questions and answers; the questions are based on ones that have been asked by players, and the answers are provided by the rules writing team and explain how the rules are intended to be used. The commentaries help provide a default setting for your games, but players should always feel free to discuss the rules before a game, and change things as they see fit if they both want to do so (changes like this are usually referred to as 'house rules').

### BLOOD BOWL RULEBOOK

**Q:** If both coaches have an Inducement, Skill, Trait, etc., that takes place at the end of a team turn, whose will resolve first? **(p.23)**

**A: The coach whose team turn has just taken place will resolve any Inducements, Skills, Traits, etc., that they have first, then their opponent will resolve any of theirs.**

* * *

**Q:** Can a team use more than one team re-roll in the same team turn? **(p.24)**

**A: Yes. Though be careful, as if you use them all early on in a half you will be facing quite a few turns without any! Remember that you can never re-roll a re-roll.**

* * *

**Q:** Are team re-rolls that are not spent during the first half lost for the second half as it states that only spent team re-rolls are replenished and unused ones are not carried over? **(p.24)**

**A: No. What this means is that a team will always start each half with their full complement of team re-rolls, and those that are not spent in the first half cannot then be saved to add on to your store of team re-rolls. A team that starts the first half with 3 team re-rolls, will also start the second half with 3 re-rolls.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player re-rolls a single dice from a dice pool with a Skill (e.g., Brawler), can they then use a team re-roll to allow them to re-roll the other dice from the same dice pool? **(p.24)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** What exactly can a team re-roll be used to re-roll? **(p.24)**

**A: A team re-roll can only be used when a team is active and during its own team turn. It can be used to re-roll all the dice in a dice pool that were rolled during their team turn, including any dice pools rolled for any Skills or Traits used during that team turn. A team re-roll may not be used to re- roll the following rolls: Deviation, Scatter, Bounce, Armour, Injury, Casualty, Throw-in, Bribes, and Argue the Call.**

* * *

**Q:** Can I use a team re-roll to force an opposing coach to re-roll a dice in any circumstances? **(p.24)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player is bitten by a Vampire as a result of a failed Bloodlust roll and becomes Stunned (even if already Stunned), do they roll over and become Prone at the end of the turn in which they were Stunned, or the following turn? **(p.27)**

**A: At the end of the following turn.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player with a PA of 1+ scores a 1 for a Passing Ability test, after modifiers have been applied, is this still an Accurate Pass? **(p.29)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** Can a team remove a team re-roll from their roster during a league in order to lower their Team Value? **(p.34)**

**A: No. Once a team re-roll has been bought it is permanent for the duration of the league.**

* * *

**Q:** When the Sweltering Heat result is rolled on the Weather table, is a single D3 rolled to determine the number of players from each team affected, or do both coaches roll a separate D3? **(p.37)**

**A: A single D3 is rolled and the same result is applied to each team.**

* * *

**Q:** If a team has fewer than 11 available players for a game, are they required to take on enough Journeymen to take their team temporarily to 11 before taking other Inducements such as Star Players? **(p.38)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** After purchasing Inducements, do you add the value of the Inducements to your Current Team Value (CTV) when recalculating your CTV to determine which team is the "Underdog"? **(p.38)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** If two teams have the same CTV, do either team gain Inducements and can either team spend gold pieces from their Treasury? **(p.38)**

**A: No to both questions.**

* * *

**Q:** During the Determine Kicking Team step, does the team that wins the coin toss or roll-off automatically become the kicking team, or may they choose to be either the kicking or receiving team? **(p.38)**

**A: They may choose.**

* * *

**Q:** If a team with the Low Cost Linemen special rule is forced to take on Journeymen, does the value of the Journeymen increase the Current Team Value of the team? **(p.38 & 106)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** Do Inducements purchased at step 4 of the pre-game sequence add to a team's Current Team Value (CTV) when CTV is recalculated when working out which team is the Underdog? **(p.38)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player is Sent-off as a result of Too Many Players, can their coach Argue the Call or use a Bribe to avoid them being Sent-off? **(p.40)**

**A: Yes, however, players that avoid being Sent-off in this manner do not stay on the pitch and will instead be placed in the Reserves box.**

* * *

**Q:** When a team sets up additional players on the pitch as a result of the Swarming trait, and this takes the number of players on the pitch to above 11, can players on that team be Sent-off as per the Too Many Players rule during that drive? **(p.40 & 87)**

**A: No. The Too Many Players rule is used when there are more players than the team is allowed on the pitch (usually 11). The Swarming trait increases the number of players that team is allowed to field by D3 for the duration of the drive so, as long as the team does not exceed the new limit, their players cannot be Sent-off for Too Many Players. If there are any players fielded above the new limit for the Swarming team, they can be Sent-off for Too Many Players as normal.**

* * *

**Q:** What happens if a team cannot nominate a kicking player as all their players are either on the Line of Scrimmage or in a Wide Zone? **(p.40)**

**A: In this instance, simply nominate a player on the Line of Scrimmage instead.**

* * *

**Q:** If I roll a Blitz result on the Kick-off Event table, it states I am allowed to activate D3+3 Open players. Do these players need to be Open when the Kick-off event is rolled, or can I activate players that become Open during the Blitz, such as if a player pushes an opposition player away from a team-mate so that they are now Open? **(p.41)**

**A: They must be Open at the time of the Kick-off event.**

* * *

**Q:** During a Blitz result on the Kick-off Event table, if a player from the receiving team is Knocked Down does this end the Blitz? **(p.41)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** Can Special actions that replace the Block action performed as part of a Blitz action be used during the Blitz Kick-off Event? **(p.41)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** If, during a Blitz kick-off event, a player with the Animal Savagery trait knocks down a player on their team as part of the Animal Savagery trait, will that cause the Blitz kick-off event to immediately end? **(p.41 & p.81)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** When a Blitz result is rolled on the Kick-off Event table, it states one player may perform a Blitz action and one may perform a Throw Team-mate action. Are these included in the D3+3 players that can be activated, or in addition? **(p.41)**

**A: These are included as part of the D3+3.**

* * *

**Q:** During a Blitz result on the Kick-Off Event table, can I use a team re-roll? **(p.41)**

**A: No. A Kick-Off Blitz isn't a team turn. It represents the kicking team springing into action ahead of the receiving team.**

* * *

**Q:** Can a coach attempt to Argue the Call if a player is Sent-off as a result of the Officious Ref result on the Kick-off Event table? **(p.41)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** Can a Bribe be used to prevent a player being Sent-off as a result of the Officious Ref Kick-off event? **(p.41)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** If a tie is rolled for a Pitch Invasion on the Kick-off Event table, is a single D3 rolled to determine the number of players from each team affected, or do both coaches roll a separate D3? **(p.41)**

**A: A single D3 is rolled and the same result is applied to each team.**

* * *

**Q:** The rules for team turns state that a team turn ends when all eligible players have been activated. However, the rules for player activations state that coaches are not obliged to activate every player. Does this mean that coaches can choose to end their team turn without activating all of their eligible players if they wish? **(p.42)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** Can a player that performed a Special action also make a Move action before or after performing the Special action? **(p.43)**

**A: No, unless the Special action in question specifically states otherwise or is performed as part of a Blitz action (if applicable). Note that some Special actions that can be used as part of a Blitz action also state that the player cannot move after performing the Special action.**

* * *

**Q:** Can a player with a MA of 2 or less attempt to Rush to Stand Up instead of attempting to roll a 4+ to stand up? **(p.44)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** Can the Pro skill be used to re-roll the dice when a player attempts to stand up? **(p.44)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** Does a player who has the Jump Up skill still need to roll to stand up if they also have a Movement Allowance of 2 or less? **(p.44 & 75)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player that wishes to Jump over another player has no Movement Allowance remaining, can they Rush to Jump over the player? If so, how many Rush rolls are required? **(p.45)**

**A: Yes. Two Rush rolls will be required, one for each space moved. If the first Rush roll is failed, the player will Fall Over in the square they were in rather than the one they were attempting to Jump into.**

* * *

**Q:** What exactly is a Blitz action? **(p.46)**

**A: A Blitz action is a single declared action that comprises both a Move action and a Block action. If a player that declared a Blitz action is forced to lose its action, then it will lose the entire Blitz action.**

* * *

**Q:** Does a player that has declared a Blitz action have to perform a Block action as part of their Blitz action, or can they choose not to? **(p.46)**

**A: They may choose not to. However, this will still use the team's Blitz action for that turn.**

* * *

**Q:** Can a player declare a Blitz action even if they have no target in range? **(p.46)**

**A: Yes. They must still declare a target of the Block action (even if the target is not in range), and this will still use the team's Blitz action for the turn.**

* * *

**Q:** When a player declares an opposition player as the target of a Blitz action, can they change their mind during the Blitz action and instead make the Block action against a different player? **(p.46)**

**A: No. When a player declares a Blitz action against an opposition player, the targeted player is the only player they may perform the Block action against. They may choose not to make the Block action at all, though the team's Blitz action for the turn is still used.**

* * *

**Q:** Can a player make a Pass action to an adjacent friendly player? **(p.48)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** When making a Passing Ability test, if the roll is not a natural 1, but is reduced to less than 1 after modifiers have been applied, is this an inaccurate pass or a wildly inaccurate pass? **(p.49)**

**A: This will be a wildly inaccurate pass.**

* * *

**Q:** If an inaccurate or wildly inaccurate pass goes out of bounds, do you roll for passing interference before or after the throw-in? If before, where do you count the ball as for the purpose of placing the range ruler to determine which players can attempt to interfere? **(p. 50)**

**A: Before. When placing the range ruler to determine which players can attempt to interfere, treat the ball as occupying the last square it was over before going out of bounds.**

* * *

**Q:** When resolving a Throw-in, is the square which has the Blood Bowl logo from the Throw-in template on it treated as the first square along the path, or is it treated as 'square 0' and the distance is measured from that square? **(p.51)**

**A: It is treated as square 0.**

* * *

**Q:** If a thrown player lands in an occupied square and then subsequently bounces into another occupied square, is the player that is in the new occupied square also Knocked Down? **(p.54)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player with the Mighty Blow (+X) skill makes a Block action, and chooses the Both Down result and is Knocked Down themselves, can they still apply the effects of Mighty Blow (+X)? **(p.57 & 80)**

**A: No, as when the Armour roll is made for the opposition player, the player with Mighty Blow (+X) is Prone and so cannot use the skill.**

* * *

**Q:** When a player makes a Blitz action, do they have to nominate the target of the Block action before the player is moved? **(p.59)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** What happens if a player suffers a characteristic reduction as the result of an injury, but the characteristic that would be reduced is already at its minimum value? For example, an ST 1 player that suffers a Dislocated Shoulder (-1 ST) or a player with a Passing Ability of 6+ suffers a Broken Arm (-1 PA). **(p.61)**

**A:** If a player that suffers a characteristic reduction is already at their minimum value, it cannot be reduced further. Instead, roll again on the Lasting Injury table until a different result that can be applied is rolled.

* * *

**Q:** If a player with a Passing Ability of 6+ suffers a Broken Arm and has their PA reduced by 1, what happens? **(p.61)**

**A: Characteristics can ever be reduced below the minimum value shown on page 28 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook, so nothing would happen.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player is Sent-off, which happens first: using a Bribe, Argue the Call, or is the order up to the Sent-off player's coach? **(p.63 & 91)**

**A: Argue the Call will always happen first, followed by any Bribes (if able).**

* * *

**Q:** Do I have to Argue the Call in order to use a Bribe? **(p.63 & 91)**

**A: No, but should the Bribe fail, you cannot then attempt to Argue the Call as the chance to do so has passed.**

* * *

**Q:** If a coach is ejected for having rolled a 1 when attempting to Argue the Call, are they only prevented from using a Bribe Inducement for that one sending off, or for the rest of the game? **(p.63 & 91)**

**A: Just for that particular sending off.**

* * *

**Q:** During the End of Drive Sequence, what happens first: players are Sent-off for the Secret Weapon trait, or any end of drive weather effects (such as Sweltering Heat)? **(p.66)**

**A: During the End of Drive Sequence, Secret Weapons are always Sent-off before any other effects.**

* * *

**Q:** Can you clarify what the penalties are for conceding a game? **(p.67)**

**A: If a player concedes a match, they immediately lose the game. Then, follow the procedure outlined on page 67 of the Blood Bowl Rulebook.**

* * *

**Q:** If a game goes to extra time, how many additional turns are taken by each coach? **(p.67)**

**A: Each coach will take 8 team turns.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player makes a superb Kick Team-mate Special action, does it generate Star Player Points like a Throw Team-mate Special action? **(p.70)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player converts a Deflection into an Interception, will they gain 2 Star Player Points for the Interception, or 3 Star Player Points - 2 for the Interception, and 1 for the initial Deflection? **(p.70)**

**A: They will gain 2 Star Player Points for the Interception.**

* * *

**Q:** In League Play, are Infamous Coaching Staff and Infamous Sideline Staff who play in the game, such as Josef Bugman, eligible for the MVP award? **(p.70 & 93)**

**A: No. Though these folk might think of themselves as players, they are coaches and support staff - infamous ones at that!**

* * *

**Q:** What happens when a player with a PA of '-' rolls an improvement to its PA? **(p.71)**

**A: Either choose another listed option, or improve its PA to 6+.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player randomly selects a characteristic improvement, and then decides they do not want to take the characteristic improvement they have rolled, they can instead take a Secondary skill. Could they instead choose a Primary skill if they wanted? **(p.71)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** If I hire a Journeyman that gained an advancement during Step 3 of the post-game sequence, how much do they cost to hire? **(p.72)**

**A: They will cost the same as their Current Value, including the cost of any advancements gained.**

* * *

**Q:** What happens if a player rolls a random Skill and gains one that they could take, but cannot actually use? Such as if a player with the No Hands trait gained the Catch skill. **(p.74)**

**A: In these instances, roll again until they gain a Skill they could actually use.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player with an AV of 8+ (or worse) randomly gains the Iron Hard Skin skill, does this count as them gaining a Skill they cannot use as the Skill will have no effect? **(p.74)**

**A: Yes. They may re-roll.**

* * *

**Q:** Can players that are Prone, Stunned, or have lost their Tackle Zone still use skills such as Dodge, Block, Sidestep or Wrestle (amongst others)? **(p.74)**

**A: No. A player that is Prone, Stunned, or has lost their Tackle Zone cannot use any Skills or Traits unless it is specifically stated in the description of that Skill or Trait.**

* * *

**Q:** Can the Catch skill be used when attempting to catch a Bomb? **(p.75)**

**A: No, a Bomb is not a ball.**

* * *

**Q:** What happens if a player already has the Catch skill or the Monstrous Mouth skill and randomly rolls the other Skill? **(p.75 & 78)**

**A: If a player has the Monstrous Mouth skill and subsequently rolls the Catch skill, then they should re-roll. If a player has the Catch skill and subsequently rolls the Monstrous Mouth skill, then they may not re-roll, as the Monstrous Mouth skill provides an additional benefit.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player with the Diving Catch skill attempts to catch the ball when it is landing in an adjacent square and fails, does the ball bounce from the player who failed the catch, or from where it was going to initially land? **(p.75)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player with the Leap skill or Pogo Stick trait has used all of their Movement Allowance and is attempting to use the Leap skill or Pogo Stick trait to jump over a square, what happens if they fail the Rush roll? **(p.75 & 85)**

**A: If the Rush fails, then the player will fall over in the square they have moved into, do not roll the Agility test for the jumping player.**

* * *

**Q:** Can a player with the Sneaky Git skill that performs a Foul action still be Sent-off if it rolls a natural double on the Injury roll? **(p.75)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** What happens if the ball lands in the Tackle Zones of multiple players from the same team with the Diving Catch skill? **(p.75)**

**A: Each player may attempt to catch the ball, in an order chosen by the controlling coach.**

* * *

**Q:** What happens if the ball lands in the Tackle Zones of multiple players from opposing teams with the Diving Catch skill? **(p.75)**

**A: Each player may attempt to catch the ball, in an order chosen by the active team's coach.**

* * *

**Q:** Can the Dodge skill be used on moves outside of a player's activation, such as those provided from On the Ball, or the Blitz result on the Kick-off Event table? **(p.75)**

**A: No. The Dodge skill can only be used to re-roll a Dodge roll during that player's activation during their own team turn.**

* * *

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player with the Safe Pair of Hands skill is Knocked Down, and there are no empty squares for them to put the ball into, what happens? **(p.75)**

**A: The Safe Pair of Hands skill cannot be used in this instance, and so the ball will bounce as normal.**

* * *

**Q:** Can the Sure Feet skill be used on moves outside of a player's activation, such as those provided from the Blitz result on the Kick-off Event table? **(p.75)**

**A: No. The Sure Feet skill can only be used during that player's activation.**

* * *

**Q:** Can a Biased Referee be used against an opposition player with Sneaky Git that rolled a double for the Armour roll, and was not Sent-off due to the Sneaky Git skill? **(p.75 & 95)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player with the Animal Savagery trait also has the Jump Up skill, do they still get the +2 to the roll if they wish to attempt to make a Block action while prone? **(p.75 & 81)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player has both the Jump Up skill and the Stab trait, can they use the Jump Up skill to allow them to make a Block action from Prone on a 2+ and then replace this Block action with a Stab Special action? **(p.75 & 86)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** As I choose the square my player with Sidestep moves into when pushed, does this count as a voluntary move or an involuntary move for Skills such as Tentacles? **(p.75)**

**A: Involuntary. You choose the square but are still being pushed back and so moving involuntarily.**

* * *

**Q:** What is the timing of Diving Tackle and Dodge? For example, if the dodging player passes the Agility test, then my player uses a Diving Tackle to make them fail, can they re-roll the test with Dodge? Does the negative apply to the new test? **(p.75)**

**A: To dodge, a player moves into the intended square then makes an Agility test. If the test is passed without using the Dodge re-roll and a Marking player uses Diving Tackle, then a Dodge re-roll can be used to re-roll a now failed test. The dodging player must still subtract 2 from the result of the re-rolled Agility test.**

* * *

**A: No, they must still perform the Block action.**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** Can a player with the Pro skill use the re-roll outside of their activation - for example, to Catch or Intercept the ball? **(p.77)**

**A: No. The Pro skill can only be used during that player's activation.**

* * *

**Q:** What exactly can the Pro skill be used to re-roll? **(p.77)**

**A: The Pro skill can be used to re-roll a single dice rolled by that player, either on its own, as part of a multiple roll, or as part of a dice pool. It cannot be used to re-roll a dice that was rolled as part of an Armour, Injury or Casualty roll, a roll that is not made during its own activation (such as Regeneration) or a dice that is not rolled on behalf of the player specifically (such as a Bribe or Argue the Call).**

* * *

**Q:** A player with both the Pro skill and Brawler skill performs Block, rolls two Block Dice and rolls Both Down on both dice, can the controlling coach choose to use Brawler on one of the dice, and then subsequently attempt to use Pro on the other dice that has not yet been re-rolled? **(p.77 & 80)**

* * *

**Q:** If a player attempts to Dodge away from a player with the Shadowing skill, which roll happens first: the Dodge roll or the roll for Shadowing? **(p.77)**

* * *

**Q:** When a player with the Frenzy skill makes a Block action against a player with Foul Appearance, if the first Block action results in the player following up and performing a second Block action, do they need to make another roll for Foul Appearance? **(p.77 & 78)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player with the Strip Ball skill rolls a Push Back result against a player who is holding the ball, and that player is pushed into the End Zone, do they score a touchdown as described on page 64? **(p.77)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** Can the Strip Ball skill be used to make a player who used the Stand Firm skill drop the ball? **(p.77 & 80)**

**A: Yes, if the player chooses not to be pushed back, they will drop the ball in the square they are standing in.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player has both the Frenzy skill and the Stab trait, if they declare a Block action which results in a Pushed Back result when they follow up and have to perform a second Block action, can they then use the Stab trait to replace the second Block action with the Stab Special action? **(p.77 & 86)**

* * *

**Q:** If a player with the Foul Appearance skill is chosen as the target of a Blitz action, when do they roll to see if the action is wasted? **(p.78)**

* * *

**Q:** When a player dodges while being Marked by a player with Tentacles, do they move into the new square, resolve any effects (such as picking up a ball) and then resolve the Tentacles roll? **(p.78)**

**A: The Tentacles skill is resolved first. As the player tries to move, if the Tentacles roll is a result of 6 or higher, or a natural 6, then the player hasn’t moved into the square and so cannot try to pick up the ball.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player with the Foul Appearance skill is chosen as the target of a Foul action, does the player that declared them as the target of a Foul action have to make the roll for Foul Appearance? **(p.78)**

**A: No, as Foul Appearance only triggers when the player is chosen as the target of either a Block action or a Special action.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player uses the Ball & Chain Move special action and moves out of the Tackle Zone of a player with the Tentacles skill, does the player with Tentacles get to use the Skill? **(p.78 & 82)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player with a Trait that requires them to roll a dice to see if they can activate normally (such as Bone Head or Unchanneled Fury) and wishes to declare a player with either the Foul Appearance or Dump-off skills as the target of an action, do they roll for their Trait or for the opposing player's Skill first? **(p.78 & 79)**

**A: The player will first nominate the target of their action, then roll for their Trait and then the opposing player will use their Skill**

* * *

**Q:** Can a player with both the Dump-off and the Pass skills use the Pass skill when making a Pass action as part of the Dump- off skill? **(p.79)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** When a player with the Dump-off skill is nominated as the target of a Blitz action, when do they make their Quick Pass action? **(p.79)**

**A: As soon as they are nominated as the target of the Blitz action.**

* * *

**Q:** Can multiple players from the same team use the On The Ball skill in response to the same Pass action? If so, what happens if one of them Falls Over before the others have been able to use the On The Ball skill? **(p.79)**

**A: Yes. However, if one player Falls Over before the others have been able to use the On The Ball skill then the sequence ends and no further players can move.**

* * *

**Q:** Can any of the Passing skills that are used when performing a Pass action also be used when performing a Throw Team-mate action? **(p.79)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** Is a Hail Mary Pass treated as a Long bomb when determining any modifiers for testing for accuracy? **(p.79)** **A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player with the Leader re-roll is removed from the pitch before their Leader re-roll has been used, then the re-roll would be lost. If the player would subsequently return to the pitch (such as recovering from being KO'd), is the re-roll available again? **(p.79)**

* * *

**Q:** If a player with Multiple Block also has the Grab skill, can they place the second opposition player that they Blocked into the square that was initially occupied by the first opposition player that they Blocked? **(p.80)**

**A: This means that the player may perform this action for free. This Skill cannot be used if the team has already used their Foul action for that team turn, and if used will mean that another player cannot also make a Foul action during the same team turn.**

* * *

**Q:** Does the free Foul action from Pile Driver happen before or after making the Armour roll (and potentially an Injury roll) for the player being Knocked Down? **(p.80)**

**A: After - so long as the player is still on the pitch, of course!**

* * *

* * *

**Q:** If a player with Animal Savagery knocks down a friendly model, are they forced to use Claws, Piledriver, Mighty Blow (X+) (or any other Skills that would affect Armour or Injury rolls), or can they choose not to? **(p.81)**

* * *

**Q:** Does a player with the Animosity (X) trait make the roll to see whether they can perform a Pass action or Hand-off action to the relevant player at the start of their activation or just before attempting the desired action? **(p.81)**

* * *

* * *

**Q:** Can a player with the Hypnotic Gaze trait perform the Hypnotic Gaze Special action in the same activation in which they declared a Block action, Blitz action, Foul action or Pass action? **(p.85)**

* * *

**Q:** If a Vampire player declares a Blitz action, fails their Bloodlust roll and changes their action to the Move action, can they then use the Hypnotic Gaze trait during the move? **(p.85)**

* * *

**Q:** Can a Prone player who becomes Rooted still stand up? **(p.87)**

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** When using a Bribe, can I use additional Bribes if the first one fails? **(p.91)**

**A: Yes. What kind of self-respecting referee is going to turn down more gold?**

* * *

**Q:** If a player holding the ball is turned into a frog as the result of the Zap! spell and the ball is forced to bounce, is a Turnover caused? **(p.94)**

**A: No.**

* * *

**Q:** If I have induced a Biased Referee, does this mean my coach cannot be ejected when Arguing the Call as the Biased Referee gives a bonus of +1 when rolling to Argue the Call, and the coach is only ejected on the roll of a 1? Or is a natural 1 always a failure? **(p.95)**

**A: A natural 1 is not always a failure when rolling to Argue the Call, so having a Biased Referee means that the coach cannot be ejected as they will always receive the +1 to the roll.**

* * *

**A: A team will score this bonus League point if their opponent fails to score any touchdowns.**

* * *

**A: Yes.**

* * *

**Q:** When re-drafting a team, are a player's agent's fees (the +20,000 gold pieces per season they have played) added to the Team Draft list, or is the +20,000 gold pieces only used for initially re-hiring the player in question? **(p.100)**

**A: Only for re-hiring a player in question. So, a player that is worth 50,000 gold pieces could be hired for 70,000 gold pieces from your budget in their second season, but would still be worth 50,000 gold pieces on the Team Draft list.**

* * *

**Q:** Can a team with the Masters of Undeath special rule still attempt to Raise the Dead if the Necromancer has been Sent Off? **(p.106)**

**A: Yes.**

**A: At the start of his activation**

* * *

**Q:** When using Helmut Wulf’s Old Pro special rule, do you still need to roll for the Pro skill? **(p.131)**

**A: Yes. Old Pro offers an alternative way to use the Pro skill, so you must still roll a D6 as described in the skill. If the Pro skill roll fails, then you may attempt to use Old Pro again in a later turn – the once per game use comes into effect only when you actually re-roll a dice as part of an Armour roll.**

* * *

**Q:** If Lord Borak the Despoiler is KO'd or removed as a Casualty and then subsequently returns to the pitch, does he still lose his re-roll? **(p.131)**

### SPIKE! MAGAZINE ISSUE 17 - GNOMES

**Q:** When a player uses the Trickster trait, does the player being removed from the pitch and then placed again count as the player moving? **(p.5)**

**A: No; it is a placement not a movement. As such, any rules that interact with a player moving, such as the Shadowing or Tentacles skills, will not come into effect.**

* * *

**Q:** If a player uses the Trickster trait and places themselves in a square containing the ball, do they attempt to pick it up? **(p.5)**

* * *

### SPIKE! MAGAZINE ISSUE 18 – CHAOS DWARF

**Q:** When fouling a player with Iron Hard Skin, do you get modifiers to the roll for Foul Assists? **(p.5)**

ERRATA MAY 2025
---------------

The following errata correct errors in the Blood Bowl rulebook any issues of _Spike! Journal_ and any supplements associated with the Second Season Edition of the game.

The errata are updated regularly; when changes are made any changes from the previous version will be highlighted in **magenta**. Where the update has a note, e.g., "Regional updateJ, this means it has had a local update, only in that language, to clarify a translation issue or other minor correction.

### BLOOD BOWL RULEBOOK

*   **Page 38 - Inducements - Opening paragraph, Petty Cash & Treasury**
    
*   Replace these sections with the following:
    

_Ahead of any league fixture, play-off game, or friendly, teams may get the opportunity to spend gold pieces from their Treasury or Petty Cash (or both) to purchase Inducements. If one team has a lower CTV (including the value of any Journeymen players) then it will be given 'petty cash' to spend on Inducements. To work out how much petty cash a team will receive, follow the steps below in order:_

*   The team with the higher CTV gets the opportunity to spend any gold pieces from their Treasury to purchase any Inducements.
*   The team with the lower CTV then gets an amount of petty cash equal to the difference in CTV between the two teams, plus an amount equal to the amount of gold the other team spent from its Treasury.
*   The team with the lower CTV can then spend this petty cash on Inducements, though any petty cash not spent is lost. They may not spend gold pieces from their Treasury.

* * *

*   **Page 54 - Landing in an Occupied Square**
    
*   Replace this section with the following:
    

_If after the scatter has been resolved, the thrown player lands in an occupied square:_

*   The player occupying the square is Knocked Down (an Armour roll and possible Injury roll is made against them even if they were already Prone or Stunned). If the player occupying the square is a team-mate then a Turnover will be caused.
*   The thrown player will bounce (as if they were the ball) from the square they land in and will automatically be Knocked Down upon landing; however, unlike normally when a player is Knocked Down during their own team turn, this will not cause a Turnover unless the thrown player was holding the ball.
*   Should the thrown player bounce into another occupied square, the above process is repeated.

* * *

*   **Page 61 - Characteristic Reduction**
    
*   Change the second paragraph to read:
    

_In the case of Movement Allowance or Strength, the characteristic is simply reduced by 1. In the case of Agility or Passing Ability, the target number is raised by 1. For example, if a player with AG4+ suffers a Neck Injury, the characteristic would become AG5+. In the case of Armour Value, the target number is lowered by 1. For example, if a player with AV9+ suffers a Head Injury, the characteristic would become AV8+._

* * *

*   **Page 64 - Stalling**

* * *

*   **Page 78 – Iron Hard Skin**
    
*   Replace the entire paragraph with the following:

* * *

*   **Page 83 - Bombardier**

So, if a team had 2 players with the Swarming trait already set up on the pitch, and then rolled for 3 more players to enter the pitch via Swarming, only a maximum of 2 more Swarming players could be set up on the pitch.
